# cse241 Final Project: Regork

## Overview

This document provides an overview of how data is stored in SQL for the cse241 project. The project involves a database schema that includes various entities such as buildings, stores, suppliers, products, shipments, and manufacturing processes.

## Database Schema

### Tables

1. **Building** (`building`)

   - **Description**: A general entity representing locations.

   - **Columns**:
     - `store_id`: References the `id` from the building table (Primary Key, Foreign Key).

3. **Supplier** (`supplierb`)

   - **Description**: Another specialized entity derived from the building entity, representing suppliers.
   - **Columns**:
     - `supplier_id`: References the `id` from the building table (Primary Key, Foreign Key).
     - `supplier_name`: Name of the supplier.

4. **Product Log** (`productLog`)

     - `product_id`: References the `product_id` from the product log (Primary Key, Foreign Key).
     - `supplier_id`: References the `supplier_id` from the supplier table (Primary Key, Foreign Key).
     - `price`: Price of the product.
     - `unit_type`: Type of unit for the product (default is 'ea').

6. **Shipment Log** (`shipmentLog`)

   - **Description**: Records shipments to various locations.
   - **Columns**:
     - `shipment_id`: Unique identifier for each shipment (Primary Key).
     - `to_id`: References the `id` from the building table (Foreign Key).
     - `ship_date`: Date the shipment is sent.
     - `arrive_date`: Date the shipment arrives (must be after `ship_date`).

7. **Product Shipment** (`product_ship`)

   - **Description**: Links products to specific shipments.
   - **Columns**:
     - `shipment_id`: References the `shipment_id` from the shipment log (Primary Key, Foreign Key).
     - `product_id`: References the `product_id` from the product table (Primary Key, Foreign Key).
     - `supplier_id`: References the `supplier_id` from the supplier table (Primary Key, Foreign Key).
     - `qty`: Quantity of the product in the shipment.

8. **Manufacturing** (`manufacturingb`)
   - **Description**: Represents the relationship between products and their components.
   - **Columns**:
     - `product_id`: References the `product_id` from the product table (Primary Key, Foreign Key).
     - `supplier_id`: References the `supplier_id` from the supplier table (Primary Key, Foreign Key).
     - `component`: Name of the component used in manufacturing.

### Views

1. **Store View**

   - Combines data from the `storeb` and `building` tables to provide a comprehensive view of stores, including their locations.

2. **Supplier View**

   - Combines data from the `supplierb` and `building` tables to provide a comprehensive view of suppliers, including their locations.

3. **Product View**

   - Combines data from the `productb`, `productlog`, and `supplierb` tables to provide a comprehensive view of products, their suppliers, and pricing.

4. **Shipment View**

   - Combines data from the `product_ship`, `shipmentLog`, `productLog`, `productb`, and `supplierb` tables to provide a comprehensive view of shipments, including products, quantities, prices, and suppliers.

5. **Manufacturing View**
   - Combines data from the `manufacturingb` and `product` tables to provide a comprehensive view of manufacturing processes.

## Relationships

- **Building** is the parent/general entity for both **Store** and **Supplier**, establishing a one-to-many relationship.
- **Product** is linked to **Supplier** and **Product Log**, establishing a many-to-one relationship.
- **Shipment Log** is linked to **Building**, establishing a many-to-one relationship.
- **Product Shipment** creates a many-to-many relationship between **Product** and **Shipment Log**.
- **Manufacturing** establishes a many-to-many relationship between **Product** and **Supplier** through components.

This schema allows for efficient data retrieval and management, ensuring that all entities are properly linked and that data integrity is maintained throughout the database.
