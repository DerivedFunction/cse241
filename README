# cse241 Final Project: Regork

## Overview

By Denny Li

This document provides an overview of how data is stored in SQL for the cse241 project. The project involves a database schema that includes various entities such as buildings, stores, suppliers, products, shipments, and manufacturing processes.
![ERD Diagram](./ERD.png)

## How It Works

1. Compile and run the program using `runLinux.sh` or `runWindows.sh`.
2. When prompted, enter username and password to open to the interface.
3. Choose between 2 user login options: as a store manager or as a supplier.

## Database Schema

### Tables

1. **Building** (`building`)

   - **Description**: A general entity representing locations.
   - **Columns**:
     - `id`: Unique identifier for each building (Primary Key).
     - `location`: The physical location of the building.

2. **Store** (`storeb`)

   - **Description**: A specialized entity derived from the building entity.
   - **Columns**:
     - `store_id`: References the `id` from the `building` table (Primary Key, Foreign Key).

3. **Supplier** (`supplierb`)

   - **Description**: Another specialized entity derived from the building entity, representing suppliers.
   - **Columns**:
     - `supplier_id`: References the `id` from the `building` table (Primary Key, Foreign Key).
     - `supplier_name`: Name of the supplier.

4. **Product Log** (`productLog`)

   - **Description**: A table that logs generic products.
   - **Columns**:
     - `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product (Primary Key).
     - `product_name`: Name of the product.

5. **Product** (`productb`)

   - **Description**: Links products to suppliers and includes pricing information.
   - **Columns**:
     - `product_id`: References the `product_id` from the `productLog` (Primary Key, Foreign Key).
     - `supplier_id`: References the `supplier_id` from the `supplier` table (Primary Key, Foreign Key).
     - `price`: Price of the product.
     - `unit_type`: Type of unit for the product (default is `'ea'`).

6. **Shipment Log** (`shipmentLog`)

   - **Description**: Records shipments to various locations.
   - **Columns**:
     - `shipment_id`: Unique identifier for each shipment (Primary Key).
     - `to_id`: References the `id` from the `building` table (Foreign Key).
     - `ship_date`: Date the shipment is sent.
     - `arrive_date`: Date the shipment arrives (must be after `ship_date`).

7. **Product Shipment** (`product_ship`)

   - **Description**: Links products to specific shipments.
   - **Columns**:
     - `shipment_id`: References the `shipment_id` from the `shipmentLog` (Foreign Key).
     - `product_id`: References the `product_id` from the `productb` table (Foreign Key).
     - `supplier_id`: References the `supplier_id` from the `productb` table (Foreign Key).
     - `qty`: Quantity of the product in the shipment.

8. **Manufacturing** (`manufacturingb`)
   - **Description**: Represents the relationship between products and their components.
   - **Columns**:
     - `manufacturing_id`: Unique identifier for each component-supplier-product pair. This makes it easier to index each element. (Primary Key)
     - `product_id`: References the `product_id` from the product table (Foreign Key).
     - `supplier_id`: References the `supplier_id` from the supplier table (Foreign Key).
     - `component`: Name of the component used in manufacturing. Cannot be null

### Views

1. **`store` View**

   - Combines data from the `storeb` and `building` tables to provide a comprehensive view of stores, including their locations.

2. **`supplier` View**

   - Combines data from the `supplierb` and `building` tables to provide a comprehensive view of suppliers, including their locations.

3. **`product` View**

   - Combines data from the `productb`, `productlog`, and `supplierb` tables to provide a comprehensive view of products, their suppliers, and pricing.

4. **`shipment` View**

   - Combines data from the `product_ship`, `shipmentLog`, `productLog`, `productb`, and `supplierb` tables to provide a comprehensive view of shipments, including products, quantities, prices, and suppliers.

5. **`manufacturing` View**
   - Combines data from the `manufacturingb` and `product` tables to provide a comprehensive view of manufacturing processes.

## Relationships

- **Building** is the parent/general entity for both **Store** and **Supplier**.
- **Product** is linked to **Supplier** and **Product Log**, establishing a many-to-many relationship, and
  many-to-one with total participation, respectively.
- **Shipment Log** is linked to **Building**, establishing a many-to-one relationship.
- **Product Shipment** is linked to **Product**, **Supplier**, and **Shipment Log** establishing a many to one relationship.
- **Manufacturing** establishes a many-to-many relationship between **Product** and **Supplier** through components.

This schema allows for efficient data retrieval and management, ensuring that all entities are properly linked and that data integrity is maintained throughout the database.
